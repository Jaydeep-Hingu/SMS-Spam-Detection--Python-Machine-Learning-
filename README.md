# SMS-Spam-Detection--Python-Machine-Learning-
Developed a classification system to detect spam messages using Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, and Decision Trees.

Implemented text preprocessing and vectorization (TF-IDF/CountVectorizer) along with feature scaling.

Evaluated performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Achieved ~95% accuracy in spam classification.
